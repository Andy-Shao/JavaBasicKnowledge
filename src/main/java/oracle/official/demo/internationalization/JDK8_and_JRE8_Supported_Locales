The set of supported locales varies between different implementations of the Java Platform
Standard Edition (Java SE) as well as between different areas of functionality.
This page documents locale support in Oracle's Java SE Development Kit 8 (JDK) and Java SE
Runtime Environment 8 (JRE).

#Installer and Supported Languages
The JRE and JDK Installers are localized to the languages specified in the User_Interface_ 
Translation. The installers will use the use the system's default locale setting to determine 
which of the supported languages to use at the time of installation. If the system's default locale is 
not supported by the installer, the installer will be displayed in English.
The complete international version of the JRE is installed.
