Before we go to the details of the contents of the individual configuration files, some format convention needs to be defined. In 
most cases, information contained within the manifest file and signature files is represented as so-called "name: value" pairs 
inspired by the RFC822 standard.  We also call these pairs headers or attributes.
Groups of name-value pairs are known as a "section". Sections are separated from other sections by empty lines.

Binary data of any form is represented as base64. Continuations are required for binary data which causes line length to exceed 72 
bytes. Examples of binary data are digests and signatures.

Implementations shall support header values of up to 65535 bytes.

All the specifications in this document use the same grammar in which terminal symbols are shown in fixed width font and 
non-terminal symbols are shown in italic type face.

#Specification:

  section:                       *header +newline
  nonempty-section:      +header +newline
  newline:                      CR LF | LF | CR (not followed by LF)
  header:                       name : value
  name:                         alphanum *headerchar
  value:                          SPACE *otherchar newline *continuation
  continuation:              SPACE *otherchar newline
  alphanum:                  {A-Z} | {a-z} | {0-9}
  headerchar:                alphanum | - | _
  otherchar:                  any UTF-8 character except NUL, CR and LF
; Also: To prevent mangling of files sent via straight e-mail, no
; header will start with the four letters "From".
 

Non-terminal symbols defined in the above specification will be referenced in the following specifications.
