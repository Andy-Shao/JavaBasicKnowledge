#I/O Streams
An I/O Stream represents an input source or an output destination. A stream can represent many different kinds of 
sources and destinations, including disk files, devices, other programs, and memory arrays.

Streams support many different kinds of data, including simple bytes, primitive data types, localized characters, and 
objects. Some streams simply pass on data; others manipulate and transform the data in useful ways.

No matter how they work internally, all streams present the same simple model to programs that use them: A stream 
is a sequence of data. A program uses an input stream to read data from a source, one item at a time.
A program uses an output stream to write data to a destination, one item at time.
