/**
 * http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/charstreams.html<br>
 * Descript:
 * The Java platform stores character values using Unicode conventions. Character stream I/O automatically translates 
 * this internal format to and from the local character set. In Western locales, the local character set is usually an 8-bit
 * superset of ASCII.
 * <br>
 * For most applications, I/O with character streams is no more complicated than I/O with byte streams. Input and 
 * output done with stream classes automatically translates to and from the local character set. A program that uses 
 * character streams in place of byte streams automatically adapts to the local character set and is ready for
 * internationalization â€” all without extra effort by the programmer. 
 * <br>
 * If internationalization isn't a priority, you can simply use the character stream classes without paying much attention 
 * to character set issues. Later, if internationalization becomes a priority, your program can be adapted without 
 * extensive recoding. See the Internationalization trail for more information.
