JAR files support a wide range of functionality, including electronic signing, version control, package sealing, and 
others. What gives a JAR file this versatility? The answer is the JAR file's manifest.

The manifest is a special file that can contain information about the files packaged in a JAR file. By tailoring this 
"meta" information that the manifest contains, you enable the JAR file to serve a variety of purposes.

This lesson will explain the contents of the manifest file and show you how to work with it, with examples for the basic 
features:

#Understanding the Default Manifest
When you create a JAR file, a default manifest is created automatically. This section describes the default manifest.

##Understanding the Default Manifest
When you create a JAR file, it automatically receives a default manifest file. There can be only one manifest file in an 
archive, and it always has the pathname
    META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
When you create a JAR file, the default manifest file simply contains the following:
    Manifest-Version: 1.0
    Created-By: 1.7.0_06 (Oracle Corporation)

These lines show that a manifest's entries take the form of "header: value" pairs. The name of a header is separated 
from its value by a colon. The default manifest conforms to version 1.0 of the manifest specification and was created 
by the 1.7.0_06 version of the JDK.

The manifest can also contain information about the other files that are packaged in the archive. Exactly what file 
information should be recorded in the manifest depends on how you intend to use the JAR file. The default manifest 
makes no assumptions about what information it should record about other files.

Digest information is not included in the default manifest. To learn more about digests and signing, see the Signing 
and Verifying JAR Files lesson.

##Modifying a Manifest File
You use the m command-line option to add custom information to the manifest during creation of a JAR file. This 
section describes the m option.

The Jar tool automatically puts a default manifest with the pathname META-INF/MANIFEST.MF into any JAR file you 
create. You can enable special JAR file functionality, such as package sealing, by modifying the default manifest. 
Typically, modifying the default manifest involves adding special-purpose headers to the manifest that allow the JAR 
file to perform a particular desired function.

To modify the manifest, you must first prepare a text file containing the information you wish to add to the manifest. 
You then use the Jar tool's m option to add the information in your file to the manifest.
--
Warning: The text file from which you are creating the manifest must end with a new line or carriage return. 
The last line will not be parsed properly if it does not end with a new line or carriage return.
--

The basic command has this format:
    jar cfm jar-file manifest-addition input-file(s)
Let's look at the options and arguments used in this command:
    * The c option indicates that you want to create a JAR file.
    * The m option indicates that you want to merge information from an existing file into the manifest file of the JAR 
      file you're creating.
    * The f option indicates that you want the output to go to a file (the JAR file you're creating) rather than to 
      standard output.
    * manifest-addition is the name (or path and name) of the existing text file whose contents you want to add to 
      the contents of JAR file's manifest.
    * jar-file is the name that you want the resulting JAR file to have.
    * The input-file(s) argument is a space-separated list of one or more files that you want to be placed in your 
      JAR file.

The m and f options must be in the same order as the corresponding arguments.
--
Note: The contents of the manifest must be encoded in UTF8.
--
The remaining sections of this lesson demonstrate specific modifications you may want to make to the manifest file.

##Setting an Application's Entry Point
If you have an application bundled in a JAR file, you need some way to indicate which class within the JAR file is your 
application's entry point. You provide this information with the Main-Class header in the manifest, which has the 
general form:
    Main-Class: classname
The value classname is the name of the class that is your application's entry point.

Recall that the entry point is a class having a method with signature
public static void main(String[] args).

After you have set the Main-Class header in the manifest, you then run the JAR file using the following form of the
java command:
    java -jar JAR-name
The main method of the class specified in the Main-Class header is executed.

#An Example
We want to execute the main method in the class MyClass in the package MyPackage when we run the JAR file.
We first create a text file named Manifest.txt with the following contents:
    Main-Class: MyPackage.MyClass
--
Warning: The text file must end with a new line or carriage return. The last line will not be parsed properly 
if it does not end with a new line or carriage return.
--
We then create a JAR file named MyJar.jar by entering the following command:
    jar cfm MyJar.jar Manifest.txt MyPackage/*.class
This creates the JAR file with a manifest with the following contents:
    Manifest-Version: 1.0
    Created-By: 1.7.0_06 (Oracle Corporation)
    Main-Class: MyPackage.MyClass
When you run the JAR file with the following command, the main method of MyClass executes:
    java -jar MyJar.jar
    
#Setting an Entry Point with the JAR Tool
The 'e' flag (for 'entrypoint') creates or overrides the manifest's Main-Class attribute. It can be used while creating or 
updating a JAR file. Use it to specify the application entry point without editing or creating the manifest file.
For example, this command creates app.jar where the Main-Class attribute value in the manifest is set to
MyApp:
    jar cfe app.jar app.MyApp app/MyApp.class
You can directly invoke this application by running the following command:
    java -jar app.jar
If the entrypoint class name is in a package it may use a '.' (dot) character as the delimiter. For example, if
Main.class is in a package called foo the entry point can be specified in the following ways:
    jar cfe Main.jar foo.Main foo/Main.class

##Adding Classes to the JAR File's Classpath
You may need to reference classes in other JAR files from within a JAR file.
For example, in a typical situation an applet is bundled in a JAR file whose manifest references a different JAR file (or 
several different JAR files) that serves as utilities for the purposes of that applet.
You specify classes to include in the Class-Path header field in the manifest file of an applet or application. The Class-
Path header takes the following form:
    Class-Path: jar1-name jar2-name directory-name/jar3-name
By using the Class-Path header in the manifest, you can avoid having to specify a long -classpath flag when invoking 
Java to run the your application.
--
Note: The Class-Path header points to classes or JAR files on the local network, not JAR files within the 
JAR file or classes accessible over internet protocols. To load classes in JAR files within a JAR file into the 
class path, you must write custom code to load those classes. For example, if MyJar.jar contains another 
JAR file called MyUtils.jar, you cannot use the Class-Path header in MyJar.jar's manifest to load classes 
in MyUtils.jar into the class path.

##Setting Package Version Information
You may need to include package version information in a JAR file's manifest. You provide this information with the 
following headers in the manifest:
            Headers in a manifest
Header                              Definition
Name                                The name of the specification.
Specification-Title                 The title of the specification.
Specification-Version               The version of the specification.
Specification-Vendor                The vendor of the specification.
Implementation-Title                The title of the implementation.
Implementation-Version              The build number of the implementation.
Implementation-Vendor               The vendor of the implementation.

One set of such headers can be assigned to each package. The versioning headers should appear directly beneath 
the Name header for the package. This example shows all the versioning headers:
    Name: java/util/
    Specification-Title: Java Utility Classes
    Specification-Version: 1.2
    Specification-Vendor: Example Tech, Inc.
    Implementation-Title: java.util
    Implementation-Version: build57
    Implementation-Vendor: Example Tech, Inc.
For more information about package version headers, see the Package Versioning specification.

#An Example
We want to include the headers in the example above in the manifest of MyJar.jar

We frist create a text file named Manifest.txt with the following contents:
    Name: java/util/
    Specification-Title: Java Utility Classes
    Specification-Version: 1.2
    Specification-Vendor: Example Tech, Inc.
    Implementation-Title: java.util 
    Implementation-Version: build57
    Implementation-Vendor: Example Tech, Inc.
--
Warning: The text file must end with a new line or carriage return. The last line will not be parsed properly 
if it does not end with a new line or carriage return.
--

We then create a JAR file named MyJar.jar by entering the following command:
    jar cfm MyJar.jar Manifest.txt MyPackage/*.class
This creates the JAR file with a manifest with the following contents:

    Manifest-Version: 1.0
    Created-By: 1.7.0_06 (Oracle Corporation)1
    Name: java/util/
    Specification-Title: Java Utility Classes
    Specification-Version: 1.2
    Specification-Vendor: Example Tech, Inc.
    Implementation-Title: java.util 
    Implementation-Version: build57
    Implementation-Vendor: Example Tech, Inc.

##Sealing Packages within a JAR File
Packages within JAR files can be optionally sealed, which means that all classes defined in that package must be 
archived in the same JAR file. You might want to seal a package, for example, to ensure version consistency among 
the classes in your software.

You seal a package in a JAR file by adding the Sealed header in the manifest, which has the general form:
    Name: myCompany/myPackage/
    Sealed: true
The value myCompany/myPackage/ is the name of the package to seal.

Note that the package name must end with a "/".

#An Example
We want to seal two package firstPackage and secondPackage in the JAR file MyJar.jar
We first create a text file named Manifest.txt with the following contents:
    Name: myCompany/firstPackage/
    Sealed:true
    
    Name: myCompany/secondPackage/
    Sealed:true
--
Warning: The text file must end with a new line or carriage return. The last line will not be parsed properly
if it does not end with a new line or carriage return.
--
We then create a JAR file named MyJar.jar by entering the following command:
    jar cmf MyJar.jar Manifest.txt MyPackage/*.class
This creates the JAR file with a manifest with the following contents:
    Manifest-Version: 1.0
    Created-By: 1.7.0_06 (Oracle Corporation)
    Name: myCompany/firstPackage/
    Sealed: true
    Name: myCompany/secondPackage/
    Sealed: true
    
#Sealing JAR Files
If you want to guarantee that all classes in a package come from the same code source, use JAR sealing. A sealed 
JAR specifies that all packages defined by that JAR are sealed unless overridden on a per-package basis.
To seal a JAR file, use the Sealed manifest header with the value true. For example,
    Sealed: true
specifies that all packages in this archive are sealed unless explicitly overridden for particular packages with the
Sealed attribute in a manifest entry.

##Enhancing Security with Manifest Attributes
The following JAR file manifest attributes are available to help ensure the security of your applet or Java Web Start 
application. Only the Permissions attribute is required.
    * The Permissions attribute is used to ensure that the application requests only the level of permissions that is 
      specified in the applet tag or JNLP file used to invoke the application. Use this attribute to help prevent 
      someone from re-deploying an application that is signed with your certificate and running it at a different 
      privilege level.
      This attribute is required in the manifest for the main JAR file. See Permissions Attribute in the Java Platform, 
      Standard Edition Deployment Guide for more information.
      
    * The Codebase attribute is used to ensure that the code base of the JAR file is restricted to specific domains. 
      Use this attribute to prevent someone from re-deploying your application on another website for malicious 
      purposes. See Codebase Attribute in the Java Platform, Standard Edition Deployment Guide for more 
      information.
      
    * The Application-Name attribute is used to provide the title that is shown in the security prompts for signed 
      applications. See Application-Name Attribute in the Java Platform, Standard Edition Deployment Guide for 
      more information.
      
    * The Application-Library-Allowable-Codebase attribute is used to identify the locations where your application is 
      expected to be found. Use this attribute to reduce the number of locations shown in the security prompt when 
      the JAR file is in a different location than the JNLP file or the HTML page. See Application-Library-Allowable-
      Codebase Attribute in the Java Platform, Standard Edition Deployment Guide for more information.
      
    * The Caller-Allowable-Codebase attribute is used to identify the domains from which JavaScript code can make 
      calls to your application. Use this attribute to prevent unknown JavaScript code from accessing your 
      application. See Caller-Allowable-Codebase Attribute in the Java Platform, Standard Edition Deployment Guide 
      for more information.
      
    * The Entry-Point attribute is used to identify the classes that are allowed to be used as entry points to your 
      RIA. Use this attribute to prevent unauthorized code from being run from other available entry points in the JAR 
      file. See Entry-Point Attribute in the Java Platform, Standard Edition Deployment Guide for more information.
      
    * The Trusted-Only attribute is used to prevent untrusted components from being loaded. See Trusted-Only 
      Attribute in the Java Platform, Standard Edition Deployment Guide for more information.
      
    * The Trusted-Library attribute is used to allow calls between privileged Java code and sandbox Java code 
      without prompting the user for permission. See Trusted-Library Attribute in the Java Platform, Standard Edition 
      Deployment Guide for more information.
      
See Modifying a Manifest File for information on adding these attributes to the manifest file.
