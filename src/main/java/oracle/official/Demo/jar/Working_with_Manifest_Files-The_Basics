JAR files support a wide range of functionality, including electronic signing, version control, package sealing, and 
others. What gives a JAR file this versatility? The answer is the JAR file's manifest.

The manifest is a special file that can contain information about the files packaged in a JAR file. By tailoring this 
"meta" information that the manifest contains, you enable the JAR file to serve a variety of purposes.

This lesson will explain the contents of the manifest file and show you how to work with it, with examples for the basic 
features:

#Understanding the Default Manifest
When you create a JAR file, a default manifest is created automatically. This section describes the default manifest.

#Modifying a Manifest File
This section shows you the basic method of modifying a manifest file. The later sections demonstrate specific
modifications you may want to make.

#Setting an Application's Entry Point
This section describes how to use the Main-Class header in the manifest file to set an application's entry point.

#Adding Classes to the JAR File's Classpath
This section describes how to use the Class-Path header in the manifest file to add classes in other JAR files to the
classpath when running an applet or application.

#Setting Package Version Information
This section describes how to use the package version hearders in the manifest file.

#Sealing Packages within a JAR File
This section describe how to use the package version headers in the manifest file.

#Enhancing Security with Manifest Attributes
This section describe how to use manifest attributes to increase the security of an applet or Java Web Start
application.

##Understanding the Default Manifest
When you create a JAR file, it automatically receives a default manifest file. There can be only one manifest file in an 
archive, and it always has the pathname
    META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
When you create a JAR file, the default manifest file simply contains the following:
    Manifest-Version: 1.0
    Created-By: 1.7.0_06 (Oracle Corporation)

These lines show that a manifest's entries take the form of "header: value" pairs. The name of a header is separated 
from its value by a colon. The default manifest conforms to version 1.0 of the manifest specification and was created 
by the 1.7.0_06 version of the JDK.
