Are you running Java 7?
Java 7 introduced SNI support for SSL connections and it is enabled by default.
Java 7 Security Enhancements
To disable SNI alerts, add this line to your eclipse.ini file and restart Eclipse.
-Djsse.enableSNIExtension=false
You are using https with a self-signed certificate and you did not configure http.sslVerify=false
Window->Preferences->Team->Git->Configuration
Click the New Entry button
Key = http.sslVerify
Value = false
Gitblit GO's default self-signed certificate is bound to localhost and you are trying to clone/push from a client based on an old version of JGit with a known flaw.
The repository is clone-restricted and you don't have access.
The repository is clone-restricted and your password changed.
A regression in Gitblit. :(
