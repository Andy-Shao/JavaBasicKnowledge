The following enhancements were introduced in JDK8:
    * The jjs command was introduced, which invokes the Nashorn engine either in interactive shell mode, or to interpret files.
      For more information, see the Nashorn User's Guide.
    * The java command capable of lauching JavaFX applications, provided that the JavaFX application is packaged correctly. 
      See How Classes are Found.
    * The java command man page(both nroff and HTML) has been completely reworked. The advanced options are now divided into Runtime,
      Compiler Collection, and Serviceability, according to the area that they affect. Several previously missing options are now
      described. There is alos a section package-level or class-level or class-level dependencies. See JDK-8003562.
    * JDK 8 provides remote access to diagnostic commands which were previously accessible only locally via the jcmd tool. Remote 
      access is provided using the Java Management Extensions (JMX), so diagnostic commands are exposed to a platform MBean registered
      to the platform MBean server. The MBean is the com.sun.management.DiagnosticCommandMBean interface. See the jcmd for Unix or
      Windows. 
    * The jarsigner tool contains a new option -tsapolicyid which enable you to request a signed time stamp from a Time Stamping 
      Authority and attach it to a signed JAR file. See JDK-8009636
    * You can obtain the names of the formal parameters of any method or constructor with the method 
      java.lang.reflect.Executable.getParameters. However, .class files do not store formal parameter name by default. To store formal 
      parameter names in a particular .class file, and thus enable the Reflection API to retrieve formal parameter names, compile the 
      source file with the -parameters option of the javac compiler. See JDK-8004727.
    * The type rules for binary comparisons in the Java Language Specification (JLS) Section 15.21 will now be correctly enforced by 
      javac. Since JDK5, javac has accepted some programs with Object-primitive comparisons that are incorrectly typed according to JLS
      15.21. These comparisons will now be correctly identified as type errors. See JDK-8013357.
    * The apt tool and its associated API contained in the package com.sun.mirror have been removed in this release. Use the options 
      available in the javac tool and the APIs contained in the packages javax.annotation.processing and javax.lang.model to process 
      annotations. See JDK-7041249
